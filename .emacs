;; El-get is similar to package.el(package) except for the fact that it automatically installs all the dependencies. So you donâ€™t have to care about anything else when you install a package.
;; To install it, change to your scratch buffer by typing C-x b scratch RET. Paste this code in by yanking (type C-y):

;; So the idea is that you copy/paste this code into your *scratch* buffer,
;; hit C-j, and you have a working developper edition of el-get.

;;      (eval-print-last-sexp))))

;Hit C-j to execute.
;Add these lines to your .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")
(unless (require 'el-get nil 'noerror)
  (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously

;;Jedi.el is a Python auto-completion package for Emacs.
;;Now you can install Jedi using el-get: M-x el-get-install jedi
